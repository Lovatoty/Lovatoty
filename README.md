# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi! I'm @LovatoTy, and this is my GitHub. I am a cyber security analyst, so I don't have a lot of code here. 

## What you will find here.
You will find some old projects that I have worked on over the years. I will likely start adding some Arduino code soon as well.


## How to contact me.

You can contact me via GitHub, or on LinkedIn with the same handle. I promise I will check it about every two months.
